# MCP Obfuscation Helper

A simple program that will read /temp/client_rg.srg and /temp/server_rg.srg and allow you to easily bring up the (de)obfuscated version of the class you enter into it.

Note: Requires you to decompile minecraft at least once.

Yes, I know there are more advanced/better programs out there, but I make my own solutions to my problems when I feel it would be feasable.
